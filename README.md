# Complaint Registration and Management System

CRMS is an Android Application that makes registering and managing complaints 
easy. Users can Sign In using their Google Account to file the complaint. They donâ€™t 
need to set and remember a password for using this app. This makes it easier for 
users to file a complaint with only a few clicks. Users can also view all the complaints 
filed by them previously. Users can separately view the pending and resolved 
complaints. Admin can edit and delete the complaints and provide the verdict for the 
complaints filed. Admin can also mark and unmark complaints as resolved.
